# AWS Diag Agent

**Goal:** A lightweight, container-friendly tool that pulls the last three hours of
CloudWatch/ECS data, detects critical issues (errors, 5xx/4xx, connectivity),
and produces JSON + Markdown reports plus an optional Streamlit dashboard.

Current status: ðŸŸ¢ Scaffold only (CLI stub, project layout, Poetry config).
